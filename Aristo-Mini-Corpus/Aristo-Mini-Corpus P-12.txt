Energy, once the energy is being used, the potential energy turns into *kinetic energy.
Chemical energy is a potential energy.
Plants use sunlight, air, and water to make food.
Some objects can be used over again.
Name the five main parts of a plant.
Energy makes things move.
 Water  All living things require liquid water.
The change of state from water to water vapor is called evaporation.
Most plants get light from the sun.
Here are some of the most common ones and the animals that use them.
Too much water kills a plant because the water just sitting around the plant will grow bacteria.
By contrast, not all plants need animals.
there is mechanical energy, and there is heat energy.
All animals and plants need oxygen to breathe.
People rely on many different plants and plant parts for food.
Vegetables are other plant parts.
When energy is added to water it will change states or phase.
Plants get energy from the sun through a process called photosynthesis.
Some organisms live in water, some need salt water and others can only survive with fresh water.
Plants and animals often resemble their parents.
There are four primary ways in which plants use water to survive and grow.
Food is stored energy.
Water evaporates as water vapor into the air.
The fish then uses the energy to move and grow.
Plant and animal cells have many similarities.
Water moves and changes but it does not need air to breathe or food to eat.
Electric energy to heat energy.
Only a few types of plants and animals are able to survive here.
Solar and Light energy are the energy that we can get from the sun.
Potential energy is the energy of position and kinetic energy is the energy of motion.

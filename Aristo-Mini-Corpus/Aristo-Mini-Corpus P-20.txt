The water evaporates into water vapor, the gas phase of water.
If the water is not to the desired depth, keep watering until it is.
The human and the animals without food cant live longer.
Plants need their leaves to make food, which is stored in the roots and used for energy.
Plant growth is the process by which the plant grows in size.
All animals move in the same way.
Without energy, there would be no sound.
       The chloroplasts use the chemical energy to make food.
Water and life: the roles of water in living beings and the adaptations of living beings with regards to water.
All the plants around you are breathing and releasing water, too.

Plants fix the energy from the sun by photosynthesis.
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants make food.
Energy is the internal energy of an object or substance.
Water in the ground can also be absorbed by plant roots.
Machines use energy, our bodies use energy, energy comes from the sun, energy causes forest fires, and energy helps us to grow food.
The properties of water change to those of Ice.
The biosphere for the animals, and for our human bodies must provide food either plant or animal tissue, oxygen, and water .
Animals, plants, and even bacteria also use oxygen.
PLANTS NEED OXYGEN.
Life expectancy is also used in plant or animal ecology.
potential energy Stored energy.
all green plants do.
The water cycle is powered by the energy of the sun.
Photosynthesis in the leaves makes food for the plant.
Food and oxygen is how cells get their energy.
Still no hot water.

When liquid water changes to gaseous water, energy is continuous.
A food chain has everything to do with energy.
As a plant takes water from the soil, more water with more nutrients dissolved in it will rush toward the plant.
For example, the energy that water has before it goes over a waterfall.
Plant chloroplast convert the energy of sunlight into food for the plants.
Only plants can do photosynthesis.
Water is taken in through the roots.
Water vapor is a form of water in the air.
There is no color change or any other change.
Plants get their energy from the soil through roots.
Plants make food in their leaves.

The first is water, which the plant absorbs through its roots.
Organisms and Their Environments All animals depend on plants.
Techniques to Water Your Plants Watering affects the health and appearance of your plants.
Many different kinds of animals live in water.
On the History of Plants and six On the Causes of Plants.
Plants create energy for animals to use, so they must replenish their nutrients.
Plants get their energy to grow through a process called photosynthesis.
Plants burn energy as they grow, too.

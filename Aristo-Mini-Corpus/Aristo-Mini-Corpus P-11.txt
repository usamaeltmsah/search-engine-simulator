Because plants make so much energy, they are called “producers”.
Work is done when the form of energy changes.
In plants important nutrients are carried from the soil to the plants through water.
The movement of water through the parts of a plant is called translocation.
Light energy is one of the most important thing a plant needs.
Water each tree immediately as you plant it.
All organisms need energy.
The ground-water system also moves water in that direction.
Soil and water are important resources, not only for plants but for animals as well.
Water also helps to transport all the nutrients around the plant.
Animals and plants need air, water, and space to survive.
Plants take in air through their leaves.
Energy: “I am energy and when the sunlight, water and carbon dioxide enter the plant they become energy help the plant grow.”.
There is always water in the atmosphere.
Energy from tidal changes is clean energy.
The plant needs very little water at all during the winter.
Potential energy is found in other energy forms, as well.
Animals need food, oxygen, and water.
The plant must create its own energy in order to survive.
So plants produce the food upon which all animals ultimately depend (because even if an animal eats other animals, the animals that it eats depend upon plants).
Food provides energy in the form of chemical energy.
Plants and animals are made mostly of carbon (not counting water).
The water goes back through the gills.
The water evaporated back into water vapor in the air.
Could also be called an anchor plant.
No, flowers do not make food for the plant.
Nature waters with rain, the water goes in much further.
Food, water, air hide from other animals too.
The plant uses these seeds to produce new plants.
Because resources like water and food may be limited, plant and animal species often compete with each other for food and water.

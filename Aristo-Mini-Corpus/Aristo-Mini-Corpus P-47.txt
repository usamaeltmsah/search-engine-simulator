Physical change and chemical change are the two different types of phase changes.
In discussing the energy of the phase changes in water, we found that the potential energy is treated as a negative quantity.
By breaking the sugar, the plant releases the energy it needs.
Two in all food chains is an organism that eats green things to use their energy.
Most relationships between plants and animals are carried out through the food chain, which starts with the creation of energy for plants and some fungi via sunlight.
The root helps the plant take in water and nutrients from the soil which allows it to grow and to live and it also anchors the plant helping it grow upright.
Along with carbon dioxide, plants also need water, which is gathered by the plant's roots, to make food through the process of photosynthesis.
Photosynthesis is the process that green plants use to harness the energy of the Sun.
Plants and some microorganisms are producersâ€”they make their own food.
when water is used faster than it is replaced.
Leaves can store food and water, and are modified in some plants for other purposes.
Needs of Animals & Plants Air Air is a combination of gases used differently by many organisms.
Energy may change form, but the total amount of energy in the universe stays the same.
Energy can come in several forms, such as the kinetic energy that physically moves objects or the potential energy that is in the forces within or between the objects.
Plants take in carbon dioxide from the air.
Food and other nutrients left in the soil are also used for feeding the plant.
The organelle (part of the plant cell) that makes the food from the sun and water is called chloroplast, and the food it makes is called chlorophyll.
The process by which water changes from liquid to a gas is called evaporation.
The night before taking cuttings:Water plant well (room temperature water).
The cold water is undergoing a change of phase.
Energy can also be transferred as work.
Energy is the ability to do work or cause change.
Erosion by the force of moving water.
Potential energy Kinetic energy can be stored.
Other forms of energy While we are most likely to encounter these six forms of energy in daily life, they are not the only ways that energy can be seen.
The quantity of energy required to raise the temperature of water is different depending on the phase of water.

Light is not made INTO food: light is a form of energy and so is not made into stuff.
Types of Energy Mechanical energy may be converted into other types of energy using special equipment.
Plants use oxygen and give off carbon dioxide.

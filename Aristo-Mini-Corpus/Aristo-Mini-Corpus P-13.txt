Animals who eat plants are called herbivores.
Reproduction in plant: most plants grow from seed.
â€¦The stem contains and stores most of the water for when the plant needs energy and keeps the plant upright.
Growing toward sunlight helps plants the energy they need to live.
However, many plants can die from an inadequate water supply or too much water.
Parts of Plants Used for Food Virtually all of the various parts of plants are eaten, but not every part of every plant is edible.
All living things need energy.
Surface water;
Types of Tissue in Plants How Plants Acquire Their Energy Plants must get food into their systems in order to acquire energy and continue living, similar to animals.
Electrical energy is also energy in motion.
Water dispersal Many plants have seeds that use water as a means of dispersal.
Leaves make most of the food that plants need to live and grow.
Plants require differing amounts of water.
Water is lost from the stomata of the plant.
Animals help plants because they help with their growth.
Animals need this to survive.
Non-vascular plants do not have roots.
All animals need air to live.
Most of the water on the earth is in the oceans.
Because plants are the beginning of all food chains, all plants and animals transfer the sun's energy when they eat.
Fertilizer also provides plants with nutrients and is usually given to plants when watering.
Parts of Plants Flowers and fruits are the parts of plants that are for reproduction.
Plants must break carbohydrates down into energy just as animals do.
Many plants depend on animals to thrive.
Humans (and all other animals) are dependent on plants.
No animals need air to live.
So fish lives only in water.
As the air is less dense than water, it will move to the surface of water.
Sound energy is sound energy.
Animals eat the plants that have grown with the help of the sun.
